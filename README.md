Steps TO Follow - 
1. Import Discrepencies
2. Load Data
3. Split the Data for training and testing both 80% and 20% respectively
4. Make all the data varies between [-1,1] meaning Standardization.
5. Use the Support Vector Machine Model
6. train the Model
7. Check the accuracy of the model using the training dataset
8. Check the accuracy of the model using the testing dataset.
